# coding-quiz
This is a project for my coding bootcamp to create a coding quiz that uses a timer, score tally, and local storage high score. Audio files are Royalty free. It is designed so that if I want to add more questions, I will only need to add them to questions.js, and not update any code in the script.js file.
